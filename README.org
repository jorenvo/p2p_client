** Description
See [[https://jorenvo.github.io/notes/nat_traversal/][NAT traversal]] for a high level description of how this works.
** Usage
With [[https://github.com/jorenvo/p2p_broker][p2p_broker]] running on my_p2p_broker.com register as
=my_username=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cargo run my_p2p_broker.com my_username
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Example output
The following example uses the following IPs:

- broker: 216.58.194.206
- this_client: 172.217.0.46
- other_client: 98.138.219.232

This assumes =other_client= already registered. The flow is the same,
he just types =listen<RET>=. =this_client= registers and connects to
=other_client=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Client running on 0.0.0.0:63326
Registering as this_client with 216.58.194.206:63325...
My public IP: 172.217.0.46

Listing users currently connected to 216.58.194.206:63325...
other_client               98.138.219.232:63326

Type "listen<RET>" to listen for incoming connections, type "<username><RET>" to connect to it.

Listening for incoming messages...
